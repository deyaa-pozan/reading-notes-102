### How to write it?

A JavaScript function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses ().

Function names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs (same rules as variables).

The parentheses may include parameter names separated by commas:
(parameter1, parameter2, ...)

The code to be executed, by the function, is placed inside curly brackets: {}

## Advantage of JavaScript function

*** There are mainly two advantages of JavaScript functions.***

- Code reusability: We can call a function several times so  it save coding.

- Less coding: It makes our program compact. We don’t need to write many lines of code each time to perform a common task.
