# ***What is Loops in JS?***

## Loops offer a quick and easy way to do something repeatedly , You can think of a loop as a computerized version of the game where you tell someone to take X steps in one direction, then Y steps in another

### There are many different kinds of loops

- #### ***for statement***
  - `A for loop repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false.`
   -  `for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    console.log(i)*
  }`

------------------------------------------------
- #### ***do...while statement***
  - `The do...while statement repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false.`
  - `let i = 0;
do {
  i += 1;
  console.log(i);
} while (i < 5);`

-------------------------------------------------
- #### ***while statement***
  - `A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true` 
  - `let n = 0;
let x = 0;
while (n < 3) {
